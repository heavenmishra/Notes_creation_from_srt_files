## Notes creation from srt files
This python script will generate notes for you from a brunch of srt files of a particular course.

### ***Some points to remember before using the code.***
1.All srt file of a prticular course must present in a single folder.\
2.Nameing of those srt files should start with number,followed by the seperator.\
3.If both the condations are already done then you can just clone the code and edit the constants section like give the proper srt folder path,seperator and notes name.

Enjoy the note

**Further improvement will be done soon
